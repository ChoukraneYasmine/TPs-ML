# Machine Learning TPs – 4th Year ESI
This repository contains practical assignments (TPs) from my 4th-year Machine Learning course at École Supérieure d'Informatique (ESI), Algiers. Each TP covers a fundamental ML technique, implemented from scratch and later analyzed with different hyperparameters.

## Contents

1. Logistic Regression

2. Naïve Bayes

3. Decision Trees & Ensemble Learning

4. Neural Networks

5. Regularization & Feature Selection

6. Support Vectors Machines and optimization 

## Notes
- Each TP includes theory, implementation, and analysis.

- The goal is to understand ML models deeply before using libraries like Scikit-learn.
